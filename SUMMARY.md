**The MVTec Anomaly Detection Dataset** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. It is used in the industrial domain and anomaly detection research. 

The dataset consists of 5354 images with 1888 labeled objects belonging to 48 different classes including *color*, *scratch*, *crack*, and other: *combined*, *cut*, *hole*, *contamination*, *faulty_imprint*, *poke*, *bent*, *rough*, *thread*, *glue*, *defective*, *metal_contamination*, *scratch_neck*, *manipulated_front*, *scratch_head*, *flip*, *thread_top*, *thread_side*, *broken_small*, *broken_large*, *squeeze*, *broken_teeth*, *split_teeth*, *glue_strip*, *oil*, *fabric_border*, *print*, *fold*, *squeezed_teeth*, *fabric_interior*, *gray_stroke*, *cut_inner_insulation*, *bent_wire*, *cable_swap*, *missing_cable*, *broken*, *poke_insulation*, *cut_outer_insulation*, *missing_wire*, *bent_lead*, *damaged_case*, *cut_lead*, *misplaced*, *liquid*, and *pill_type*.

Images in the MVTec AD dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. There are 4096 (77% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 15 splits in the dataset: *toothbrush* (102 images), *leather* (369 images), *capsule* (351 images), *carpet* (397 images), *bottle* (292 images), *grid* (342 images), *pill* (434 images), *screw* (480 images), *cable* (374 images), *transistor* (313 images), *zipper* (391 images), *hazelnut* (501 images), *wood* (326 images), *tile* (347 images), and *metal_nut* (335 images). The dataset was released in 2019 by the [MVTec Software GmbH, Germany](http://www.mvtec.com/).
