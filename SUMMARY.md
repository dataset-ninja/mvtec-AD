**MVTec AD: the MVTec Anomaly Detection** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and classification tasks. It is used in the anomaly detection research. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the industrial domain. 

The dataset consists of 5354 images with 1888 labeled objects belonging to 48 different classes including *color*, *scratch*, *crack*, and other: *combined*, *cut*, *hole*, *contamination*, *faulty_imprint*, *poke*, *bent*, *rough*, *thread*, *glue*, *defective*, *metal_contamination*, *scratch_neck*, *manipulated_front*, *scratch_head*, *thread_top*, *thread_side*, *flip*, *broken_small*, *squeeze*, *broken_large*, *broken_teeth*, *split_teeth*, *oil*, *glue_strip*, *print*, *fabric_border*, *fold*, *squeezed_teeth*, *fabric_interior*, *gray_stroke*, *cut_inner_insulation*, *bent_wire*, *missing_cable*, *cable_swap*, *broken*, *bent_lead*, *damaged_case*, *misplaced*, *cut_lead*, *poke_insulation*, *cut_outer_insulation*, *missing_wire*, *liquid*, and *pill_type*.

Images in the MVTec AD dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 4096 (77% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *test* (1725 images) and *train* (3629 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 15 categories: ***bottle*** (292 images), ***cable*** (374 images), ***capsule*** (351 images), ***carpet*** (397 images), ***grid*** (342 images), ***hazelnut*** (501 images), ***leather*** (369 images), ***metal_nut*** (335 images), ***pill*** (434 images), ***screw*** (480 images), ***tile*** (347 images), ***toothbrush*** (102 images), ***transistor*** (313 images), ***wood*** (326 images), and ***zipper*** (391 images). Additionally, the 4096 ***good*** images with no defects are provided. The dataset was released in 2019 by the MVTec Software GmbH, Germany.
